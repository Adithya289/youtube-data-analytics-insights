# Exploratory Data Analysing Using Youtube Video Data from Most Popular Data Analytics & Career Development Channel

## 1.1. Introduction
Founded in 2005, Youtube has grown to become the second largest search engine in the world (behind Google) that processes more than 3 billion searches per month. It is, however, generally a myth how the Youtube algorithm works, what makes a video get views and be recommended over another. In fact, YouTube has one of the largest scale and most sophisticated industrial recommendation systems in existence. For new content creators, it is a challenge to understand why a video gets video and others do not. There are many "myths" around the success of a Youtube video, for example if the video has more likes or comments, or if the video is of a certain duration. It is also worth experimenting and looking for "trends" in the topics that Youtube channels are covering in a certain niche.

I decided to gain some insights on this topic which might be useful for other new content creators. The scope of this small project is limited to data analysis channel and I will not consider other niches (that might have a different characteristics and audience base). Therefore, in this project will explore the statistics of Alex the Analyst most successful data analysis Youtube channel.

## 1.2. Aims and objectives
### Within this project, I would like to explore the following:

▪ Getting to know Youtube API and how to obtain video data.

▪ Analyzing video data and verify different common "myths" about what makes a video do well on Youtube, for example: 

* Does the number of likes and comments matter for a video to get more views? 
* Does the video duration matter for views and interaction (likes/ comments)?
* Does title length matter for views? How many tags do good performing videos have? 
* What are the common tags among these videos? 
* Across all the creators I take into consideration, how often do they upload new videos? On which days in the week? 

▪ Explore the trending topics using NLP techniques 

* Which popular topics are being covered in the videos (e.g. using wordcloud for video titles)? 
* Which video holds the highest view count among the Top 9? 
* How important are video length and posting day when it comes to a video's success?
